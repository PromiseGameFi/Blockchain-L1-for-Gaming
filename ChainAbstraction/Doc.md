### Details 

This suite of services enables a seamless user experience, allowing users to interact with blockchain-based applications without even being aware they’re using blockchain technology.

Users can simply sign in with an email address, which generates a zero-fund account for them—no seed phrases to remember, no private keys to safeguard, and no need to acquire initial funds.

With their account in place, applications can prompt users to create meta-transactions and forward them to a relayer. The relayer then submits the transaction to the network, adding NEAR to cover execution fees. The transaction is processed as if it came directly from the user, with the relayer only stepping in to attach the necessary NEAR for submission.
