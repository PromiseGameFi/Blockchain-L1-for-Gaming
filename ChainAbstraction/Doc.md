Accounts to sign transactions in other chains.

### Details 
The combination of these services allows to create a seamless user experience, in which users can use blockchain-based applications without realizing they are using a blockchain.

Users will simply login with an email, and a zero-fund account will be created for them. No seed phrases to remember, no private keys to safe keep, and no need to acquire funds.

Once having their account, apps can ask the user to create meta-transactions and send them to any relayer. The relayer will pass the transaction to the network, attaching NEAR to pay for the execution fees. The transaction will then be executed as if the user had sent it, since the relayer is only there to attach NEAR to the submission.
