multi-chain signature 
Accounts to sign transactions in other chains.

### Details 

This  services enables a seamless user experience, allowing users to interact with blockchain-based applications without even being aware they’re using blockchain technology.

Users can simply sign in with an email address, which generates a zero-fund account for them—no seed phrases to remember, no private keys to safeguard, and no need to acquire initial funds.

With their account in place, applications can prompt users to create meta-transactions and forward them to a relayer. The relayer then submits the transaction to the network,


### Example: Nonce Usage in Ethereum
In Ethereum, each account has a transaction nonce:
The nonce starts at zero for each account and increments by one with each new transaction. When a new transaction is created, it must include the next expected nonce for that account. For example, if an account has already sent 5 transactions, the next transaction should have a nonce of 6. When the transaction is submitted, the network nodes check the nonce against the account's transaction history. If the nonce doesn’t match the expected sequence, the transaction is either rejected (if the nonce is already used) or held temporarily (if it’s too high and out of sequence). This design prevents replay attacks because any attempt to reuse a previous transaction’s nonce will result in rejection since that nonce has already been processed.


### How Blockchain Systems Handle Nonce Checks
In blockchain, nonce checks work differently due to the decentralized network structure:

Distributed Ledger: Every node has access to the current state of the blockchain, including account nonces and balances. This shared ledger allows nodes to collectively check if a transaction’s nonce is correct for a given account.
Immutable Record of Nonces: Each transaction is permanently recorded on the blockchain. Once a transaction with a specific nonce is confirmed, that nonce cannot be reused by that account, effectively preventing replays.
Consensus Protocol: Miners and validators enforce nonce rules by agreeing only to add blocks containing valid transactions with correct nonces. If a transaction with an invalid nonce is detected, it is rejected during the consensus process and will not be included in a block.
Key Points Summarized
Account-Based Nonces: Every transaction must have a unique nonce that corresponds to the next expected number for that account. This ensures transaction uniqueness and correct sequencing.
Decentralized Nonce Verification: Unlike web systems with a centralized server, each node in a blockchain network checks transaction nonces using the shared ledger.
Replay Attack Prevention: Because the network will reject any transaction with a previously used nonce, replay attacks become unfeasible. This protects accounts from double-spending and other transaction replays.
