### Password-Based Key Derivation (PBKDF2):

 Generate a strong encryption key from the password using PBKDF2 with SHA-256, which is better suited for password-based encryption than a simple hash function.

### AES Encryption and Decryption:

 Encrypt and decrypt the private key using AES-256-CBC mode with a random initialization vector (IV).
### Salt and IV Management: 

Store the salt and IV along with the encrypted private key to allow decryption later.
